# Fingerprint absent machine app
Transpose data from fingerprint absent machine.

# Overview
* Created a simple Python script to edit data from a fingerprint absent machine to a more useful format for salary calculation.
* The app takes an .xlsx format and you need to specify the date time format to enable parsing
* Deployed the app via Streamlit for our HR to use.

The app can be accessed here: https://share.streamlit.io/riyan-aditya/fingerprint/main/fingerprint_app_streamlit.py
